I. Algorithm 01: Brute-force Algorithm
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 1. Algorithm's description:
Brute-force algorithm is the easiest algorithm to solve many search problem in general and the Knapsack's problem itself. The idea of brute-force algorithm applied in this problem is to create all possible combinations created from the list of items, then run through every combinations to find the best match for the dataset.
### 2. Pseudo code:
The following Codeblock quickly go through the procedure of Brute-force algorithm.
